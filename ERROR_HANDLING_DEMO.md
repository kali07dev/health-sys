# Error Handling Demo

This error handling system provides user-friendly error messages with actionable guidance.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Error Categorization
- **USER_INPUT**: Validation errors users can fix (orange styling)
- **AUTH_ERROR**: Authentication/permission issues (red styling) 
- **USER_ACTIONABLE**: Network/connection errors users can retry (blue styling)
- **SYSTEM_ERROR**: Internal system errors users cannot fix (red styling)

### 2. User-Friendly Messages
Instead of generic "Failed to..." messages, users now see:
- Clear titles explaining what went wrong
- Detailed messages with context
- Actionable suggestions with 💡 hints
- Appropriate duration based on error severity

### 3. Examples of Improved Error Messages

**Before:**
```
❌ Failed to submit incident
❌ Validation error  
❌ Authentication expired

```

**After:**
