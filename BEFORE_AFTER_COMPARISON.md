## Error Handling System - Before vs After Comparison

### ❌ BEFORE: Generic, Unhelpful Error Messages

```typescript
// Profile page errors
catch {
  toast.error("Failed to load profile")
}
catch {
  toast.error("Failed to update profile") 
}

// Report generation errors  
catch {
  toast.error("Failed to generate report")
}

// Form validation
if (password !== confirmPassword) {
  toast.error("Passwords do not match")
}

// API errors
throw new IncidentApiError('Failed to submit incident', 'UNKNOWN_ERROR')
throw new VPCApiError('File validation failed', 'INVALID_FILES', fileErrors)
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Generic "failed" messages don't explain what went wrong
- ❌ No guidance on what users can do to fix issues
- ❌ Users don't know if it's their fault or a system problem
- ❌ No distinction between temporary vs permanent errors
- ❌ Inconsistent error handling across the application

### ✅ AFTER: User-Friendly, Actionable Error Messages

```typescript
// Profile page errors
catch (error) {
  showErrorToast(error, "Unable to load your profile information")
}
catch (error) {
  showErrorToast(error, "Unable to update your profile")
}

// Report generation errors
catch (error) {
  showErrorToast(error, "Unable to generate report")
}

// Form validation
if (password !== confirmPassword) {
  showErrorToast({ code: 'PASSWORDS_MISMATCH' })
}

// API errors  
throw new IncidentApiError(
  'Unable to submit incident report. Please try again.',
  'SERVER_ERROR'
)
throw new VPCApiError(
  'file.exe exceeds the 5MB size limit', 
  'INVALID_FILES',
  fileErrors
)
```

### ✨ Key Improvements

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Clarity** | "Failed to..." | Clear explanation of what went wrong |
| **Guidance** | No suggestions | Specific actions users can take |
| **Context** | Generic messages | Tailored to error type and severity |
| **User Agency** | Helpless feeling | Users know if they can fix it |
| **Consistency** | Mixed approaches | Unified error handling system |
| **Accessibility** | Technical jargon | Plain, understandable language |
| **Visual Design** | Single red toast | Color-coded by error type with icons |
| **Duration** | Same for all errors | Varies by importance (4-8 seconds) |
| **Recovery** | Manual retry only | Automated retry suggestions where appropriate |

The new system transforms frustrating error experiences into helpful, actionable guidance that empowers users to resolve issues independently when possible, while clearly indicating when they need to wait or contact support.
